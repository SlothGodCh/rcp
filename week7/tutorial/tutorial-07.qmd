# Cleaning Up Your Commit History  
### With `git rm` and `.gitignore`

## 🧭 Goal

Learn how to remove files from Git tracking with `git rm`, and prevent them from being re-added with a `.gitignore` file.

---

## 1️⃣ Create and Clone a Repo

### On GitHub

1. Create a new repository:  
   ```
   git-ignore-cleanup
   ```
2. ✅ Check "Add a README file"

---

### In RStudio

1. Go to **File → New Project → Version Control → Git**
2. Paste the repo URL (SSH or HTTPS)
3. Choose a location and click **Create Project**

✅ You're now working in a Git-tracked project.

---

## 2️⃣ Add and Commit a File

1. Create a new `qmd` in RStudio:
   - Go to **File → New File → Quarto Document**

2. Save the file as `notes.qmd`

3. Add some content like:

   ```r
   summary(mtcars)
   ```

4. Stage and commit the file:
   ```
   "Add analysis script"
   ```

---

## 3️⃣ Accidentally Add a Data File

1. Download the data from Week 2 on Moodle, and save it into your project as `data.csv`

2. Stage and commit:  
   ```bash
   git add data.csv
   git commit -m "Add raw data"
   ```

---

## 4️⃣ Remove the File from Git, But Keep It Locally

Realise you **don’t want this in version control**, but you still need it for local use.

In the terminal:

```bash
git rm --cached data.csv
git commit -m "Stop tracking data.csv"
```

✅ `data.csv` is still on your computer, but Git will no longer track it.

---

## 5️⃣ Add It to `.gitignore`

To prevent it from being accidentally added again:

1. Open (or create) a `.gitignore` file in your repo root
2. Add:

   ```
   data.csv
   ```

3. Save and stage the `.gitignore` file
4. Commit:
   ```
   "Ignore data.csv"
   ```

---

## 🔍 Check It Worked

1. Run:

```bash
git status
```

✅ You should **not see `data.csv`** listed anywhere — Git is now ignoring it.

---

## 3️⃣ Squash Commits with Interactive Rebase

Let’s now try squashing a few commits into one clean one.

---

### Step 1: Make a Messy Commit History

1. Edit your `.qmd` file and make **3 separate commits**:

   - Add a new section or chunk → commit: `"Add section"`
   - Fix a typo → commit: `"Fix typo"`
   - Add a final comment → commit: `"Add footnote"`

✅ Commit after each change using the Git pane or terminal.

---

### Step 2: Check Your Commit History

Run in the Terminal:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

You should see something like:

```
c3d4e5f Add footnote
b2c3d4e Fix typo
a1b2c3d Add section
...
```

---

### Step 3: Start an Interactive Rebase

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

You’ll see:

```
pick a1b2c3d Add section
pick b2c3d4e Fix typo
pick c3d4e5f Add footnote
```

---

### Step 4: Squash the Commits

Change it to:

```
pick a1b2c3d Add section
squash b2c3d4e
squash c3d4e5f
```

Save and write a new combined commit message like:

```
Add section with typo fix and footnote
```

Save again to finish the rebase.

---

### Step 5: Confirm It Worked

Run:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

✅ You should now see **one clean commit** where there were three.

---

## 🧠 Reflect

- Why is `--amend` useful when working on a single file?
- When is it good practice to squash commits?
- What would happen if you did this after pushing?

---

## ✅ Summary

| Action                     | Command                            |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Fix your last commit       | `git commit --amend`               |
| Combine multiple commits   | `git rebase -i HEAD~N`             |
| Keep your history clean    | Use these **before pushing**       |

🎉 You’ve just learned to write cleaner, more professional commit histories!

# 🔁 Extension Activity: Merge vs Rebase

## 🧭 Goal

Understand the difference between `git merge` and `git rebase` by applying both to the same branches and comparing the result.

---

## 1️⃣ Setup: Create a Feature Branch

In your GitHub-connected RStudio project:

1. Create a file: `experiment.R`
2. Add one line:
   ```
   Main branch version
   ```
3. Save, stage, and commit:
   ```
   "Add base file on main"
   ```

4. Create a new branch called `feature`:

```bash
git switch -c feature
```

---

## 2️⃣ Add Work on the Feature Branch

1. Edit `experiment.R` again:
   ```
   Feature branch addition
   ```

2. Save and commit:
   ```
   "Add feature content"
   ```

✅ You now have two commits on separate branches.

---

## 3️⃣ Add a Change to `main`

1. Switch back to `main`:

```bash
git switch main
```

2. Add to the file again:
   ```
   Main branch additional note
   ```

3. Save and commit:
   ```
   "Add note on main branch"
   ```

---

## 📊 At This Point...

Your Git history looks like this:

```text
          A---B  (feature)
         /
    ---O---C  (main)
```

- `O` = Original commit
- `A` = Feature commit
- `C` = Main branch commit
- `B` = We'll merge or rebase next

---

## 4️⃣ Option A: Merge the Feature Branch

```bash
git merge feature
```

You’ll get a **merge commit**, like this:

```text
          A---B  (feature)
         /     \
    ---O---C-----M  (main)
```

✅ History shows a clear branching path and merge point.

---

## 5️⃣ Option B: Try It Again with Rebase

> This will recreate the same setup and use `rebase` instead of `merge`.

1. Reset the last merge:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

2. Switch to the `feature` branch:

```bash
git switch feature
```

3. Rebase it onto `main`:

```bash
git rebase main
```

4. Now go back to `main` and fast-forward:

```bash
git switch main
git merge feature
```

---

## 📊 After Rebase

Your Git history now looks like:

```text
    ---O---C---A'  (main, feature)
```

- `A'` is a new version of A, replayed on top of C
- No merge commit needed — linear history

---

## 🧠 Reflect

* What’s the key difference between `merge` and `rebase`?  
* Which history is easier to read?  
* When is a merge preferred?  
* Why must you be careful rebasing pushed commits?  

---

## ✅ Summary

| Action                     | Result                            |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `git merge feature`        | Preserves both branches + merge commit |
| `git rebase main` (on feature) | Rewrites feature history as linear |
| Use `merge` after pushing  | ✅ Safe for shared work |
| Use `rebase` before pushing | ✅ Keeps history clean |

🎉 You've now seen both strategies in action — use the right one for the right job!
