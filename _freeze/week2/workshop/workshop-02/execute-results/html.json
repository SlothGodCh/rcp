To complete this tutorial, you'll need the pre-built RStudio project. Go to Moodle, under Week 2, download the Tutorial 2 RStudio Project zip.\\\n    Save this file on your computer and unzip it. You can open the `.Rproj` file and that should launch RStudio.\n2.  To render into a PDF, you will need to install the `tinytex` package. There are two methods to do this:\\\n    Either `install.packages(\"tinytex\")` or at your command line type `quarto install tinytex`. Your tutors can help with this if you get stuck.\n:::\n\n## Exercise 1: RStudio Projects\n\n1. Create a new RStudio project. You can call it whatever you like, but something that will help you remember later will be advantageous.\n2. Inside the project, create a folder called `data`. \n3. Place the avian influenza data from Moodle into this folder.\n4. Create a new Quarto documengt\n5. Write your name as an author in the YAML\n6. Change the HTML theme to `cerulean`.\n7. Set the document to render as HTML and PDF.\n\n\n::: unilur-solution\nYour YAML block should now look something like this:\n\n``` yaml\ntitle: \"ETC5513: Tutorial 2 solution\"\nauthor: \"Michael Lydeamore\"\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    toc: true\n    toc_float: true\n    theme: cerulean\n```\n:::\n\n## Exercise 2: YAML and R Chunk Options\n\n1. Create a new R chunk that loads the following libraries: `rmarkdown`, `knitr`, `tidyverse`, `readr`, `kableExtra`, `ggplot2`\n2.  Change the R chunk option from to `message: false` and `warning: false`. What happens when you render the file?\n3.  Create a new section called Introduction and type using markdown the following:\\\n    \"In this tutorial we are looking at the *Avian Influenza* cases detected globally since 1997.\"\\\n    Hint: Think about the `#` character.\n4.  In the R chunk you made in Question 1, add the chunk option `echo: false`. What does this do?\n6.  Using markdown, link the words \"US CDC\" to the website https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/php/avian-flu-summary/chart-epi-curve-ah5n1.html\n\n::: unilur-solution\n1.  The first R chunk is loading all the libraries we will need for the analysis.\n2.  Chunk options in Quarto are specified using the hashpipe, `#|`. Setting `message: true` and `warning: true` provides messages about packages being successfully loaded, and potentially having mismatched versions.\n\nFor the remainder of the questions, your markdown should look like this:\n\n```` verbatim\n# Introduction\n\nIn this tutorial we are looking at the *Coronavirus* cases detected within the Hubei area as reported in the [Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/coronavirus) Journal website as of March 12, 2019.\n\n```{{r Chunk 1}}\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n#| echo: false\n#| eval: true\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n```\nIn this section we are loading all the required libraries for the tutorial.\n````\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::",
