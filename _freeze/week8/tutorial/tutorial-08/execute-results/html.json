Create a repository in GitHub that has a license, a .gitignore file and a README.md file.\n\n2. Clone the repository to your local machine\n\n3. Take the large zip file from moodle\n\n4. Stage, commit and try to push this file.\n\n5. What do you notice about the error?\n\n6. Reset your previous commit.\n\n4. Add this file **using the `git lfs` workflow**. Remember the quotes, and that your file extension is `.zip`.\n\n```\ngit lfs install\ngit lfs track \"*.zip\"\ngit add .gitattributes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Adding large file\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n5. Push the changes onto GitHub using an extended commit message.\n\n\n`git commit` (without the `-m` flag) will open a text editor for you to type your extended commit.\n\n\nAdd a git annotated tag to the most recent commit called `v1.0`.\n\n## Collaborating with others\n\nWith at least one other person, swap repository details. They do not need to add you as a collaborator at this stage.\n\nClone their repository to your computer.\n\nPractice the following:\n\n1. Open a pull request with an identified issue with the report. This doesn't have to be a real issue, it's just for practicing our issues and commit messages.\n2. Your partner should fix the issue, and close the issue using a commit message.\n3. Practice the `git fetch` workflow, to update your local database without moving `HEAD`. Then, move your repository `HEAD` to the latest commit.\n\n",
