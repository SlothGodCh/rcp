You are welcome to use the screen for demonstrating the concepts you are explaining.\n\n---\n\nYour goal is not just to show what to do, but to explain **why** you’re doing it. For example:\n\n>  \"We revert this commit instead of resetting because the commit has already been pushed and we don’t want to rewrite public history.\"\n\n---\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nYou **cannot speed up** your recording — it must be delivered in real time to ensure you're within the time limit.\n:::\n\n## Submission\n\nPlease upload the completed video file directly to Moodle.\n\n### Tips\n\n- You may pre-prepare materials (e.g., set up Git repositories or branches in advance).\n- Speak as if you're explaining these concepts to a colleague who’s **familiar with Git** but **not very experienced**.  \n  Aim for clarity and detail, not just correctness.\n- Visuals and terminal demos are recommended, but are not required — clarity of explanation matters most.\n\n## Marking rubric\n\n* Technical content of each question: 5 points each (total 10 points)\n* Explaining \"why\": 3 points\n* Overal clarity and communication: 2 points\n\n1 mark is deducted for every 30 seconds over the 10 minute time limit (maximum 3 mark deduction). A 10 minute 12 second video thus has a maximum of 14 marks.\n\n**Total: 15 marks**",
