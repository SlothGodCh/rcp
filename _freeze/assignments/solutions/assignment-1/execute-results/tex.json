Deduct 1 if data file is missing, deduct 2 if more files are missing.\n\n## Part B: Creating a reproducible report\n\n### Quarto Setup\n\nYAML options must contain:\n\n```yaml\nformat:\n    pdf: default\n    html: default\n```\n\nor similar. They can have other options inside their PDF and HTML output formats, as long as both are specified.\n\n**1 point**\n\n### R code chunk for library loading\n\n1 point: Having a chunk that loads libraries\n\n1 point: Having `message: false`, `warning: false` and `echo: false` for the chunk.\n\nTotal: **2 points**\n\n### Introduction\n\n1 point: Keeping to 4 sentences\n\n1 point: General sentence about the problem\n\n1 point: Why the problem is a problem\n\n1 point: Relevant to the chosen dataset\n\n1 point: Structure of paragraph - sentences link together\n\nTotal: **5 points**\n\n### Research question\n\n1 point: Keeping to 4 sentences\n\n2 points: Decent motivation\n\n2 points: Relevant to dataset\n\n### Dataset introduction\n\n1 point: Link to the data (properly formatted)\n\n1 point: Data description - variables, types, what cleaning done (if any), what the data is about\n\n1 point: Table shows correctly with variable names\n\n1 point: Caption\n\n1 point: Cross-reference to table somewhere in text\n\nTotal: **5 points**\n\n### Dataset Description\n\n1 point: Must be a subsection (lower level header)\n\n1 point: Screenshot of code included (either syntax is fine)\n\n1 point: Code is sensible\n\n1 point: `head` shows _only 2 rows of data_\n\n1 point: Text includes # of observations and variables\n\nTotal: **5 points**\n\n### Results\n\n1 point: Maximum two figures that are showing in text\n\n1 point: Captions on both figures\n\n2 points: Bullet points describing what is in the figure and how it relates to the question\n\n1 point: Cross-referenced in text.\n\nOnly deduct missing elements (caption, titles etc) _once_ even if missing on both figures.\n\nTotal: **5 points**\n\n## Additional:\n\n#### Template\n\n* Default gets 1 point\n* +1 point for choosing a template that isn't default\n* +1 point for correct usage of headers and sections that are showing on the page\n* Up to 2 points for other styling choices that _help_. Be strict with this, I don't expect many 5s here.\n\n#### Spelling and grammar\n\nUp to -5. Use your discretion, -5 means almost unreadable grammar.\n\n_If any students get -5 please let me know as they will need language support going forward_.\n\n#### R code style\n\nDefault here is 5 points, deduct for:\n\n* Lack of indenting\n* _Very_ poor variable names\n* Extremely long lines\n\n#### Report quality\n\nDiscretion needed here. Look at how the report flows. If elements of report block readability, deduct mark per.\n\nFor example, if code is being output that disrupts flow, that is -1 mark. If there is a broken cross-reference, -1 mark.\n\nWe're not expecting super polished research reports, but just a table and 2 plots with no linking comments is not a report.\n\n**Maximum grade: 50 points**",
