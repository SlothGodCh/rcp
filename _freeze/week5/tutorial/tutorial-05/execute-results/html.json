Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com) and log in.  \n2. Click **+ → New Repository**  \n3. Name the repository something simple, like `collab-demo`  \n4. ✅ Check **Add a README file**  \n5. Click **Create Repository**  \n6. Share the **URL** of the repository with Student B  \n\n7. Now **clone the repository to your own computer**:\n\n   - Click the green **Code** button → choose **SSH** and copy the URL  \n   - In your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone git@github.com:your-username/collab-demo.git\n   cd collab-demo\n   ```\n\n8. Create a new RStudio Project in an _existing directory_:\n    *  Open RStudio  \n    * Go to **File → New Project → Existing Directory**  \n    * Browse to the folder you just cloned (e.g., `collab-demo`)  \n    * Click **Create Project**\n\n9. Add, commit and push the `.Rproj` file that gets created:\n   \n   ```bash\n   git add .Rproj\n   git commit -m \"Add .Rproj file\"\n   git push origin main\n   ```\n\n✅ Done! Your repository is ready for your partner to fork and contribute.\n\n---\n\n## 🍴 Step 3: Student B – Fork and Contribute\n\n1. Open the repo link your partner (Student A) shared.\n2. Click the **\"Fork\"** button (top-right corner).\n3. On your forked copy, click **Code → SSH** and copy the URL.\n\n4. Open your terminal and clone your fork:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:your-username/collab-demo.git\ncd collab-demo\n```\n\n5. Open this folder in RStudio and edit the README file to include your name\n\n6. Save the file, then stage, commit, and push:\n\n```bash\ngit add README.md\ngit commit -m \"Add line to README\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n7. Go back to your forked repository on GitHub.  \n   Click **“Compare & pull request”**, then **Create pull request**.\n\n✅ You’ve submitted your contribution!\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Step 4: Student A – Review and Merge the Pull Request\n\n1. Go to your original repository on GitHub.\n2. You should see a new pull request from your partner.\n3. Click it → Review the changes.\n4. Click **Merge pull request**, then **Confirm merge**.\n5. (Optional) Delete the branch after merging.\n\n🎉 Your teammate’s changes are now part of the main repository!\n\n---\n\n## 🔁 Step 5: Switch Roles\n\nSwitch roles so both students get experience creating, forking, and merging.\n\n---\n\n# 🍴 Exercise 2: Fork a Public Repository and Make a Pull Request\n\nIn this exercise, you’ll practice contributing to an existing project by:\n\n- Forking a public repository\n- Making a simple contribution\n- Submitting a pull request (PR)\n\n---\n\n## 📦 Step 1: Fork the Repository\n\n1. Go to this GitHub repository:  \n   👉 [`https://github.com/numbats/rcp`](https://github.com/numbats/rcp)\n\n2. In the top-right corner, click the **“Fork”** button.\n\n3. GitHub will create a copy of the repo in your account.\n\n---\n\n## 💻 Step 2: Clone Your Fork\n\n1. On your forked repository page, click the green **Code** button.  \n2. Select **SSH**, then copy the URL.\n\n3. Open your terminal and run:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:your-username/rcp.git\ncd rcp\n```\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Step 3: Add Your File\n\nInside the project, you’ll see a folder called `student-record`.\n\n1. Create a new file in that folder using your GitHub username. For example:\n\n```bash\ntouch student-record/MikeLydeamore.md\n```\n\n2. Open the file and add a simple message:\n\n```markdown\nHi, I’m MikeLydeamore on GitHub! Here’s my contribution to the rcp project.\n```\n\n3. Save the file.\n\n---\n\n## 📬 Step 4: Commit and Push\n\n1. Stage and commit your file:\n\n```bash\ngit add student-record/jamie-lee.md\ngit commit -m \"Add jamie-lee.md to student-record\"\n```\n\n2. Push your changes to your fork:\n\n```bash\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Step 5: Create a Pull Request\n\n1. Go back to your fork on GitHub.  \n2. You should see a banner to **“Compare & pull request”** — click it.  \n3. Confirm the changes, then click **“Create pull request”**\n\n🎉 You’ve just submitted a real contribution to a public GitHub repository!\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Why This Matters\n\nThis is how open-source collaboration works in the real world:\n\n- You fork a project\n- Make meaningful changes\n- Propose those changes via a pull request\n- Maintainers review and (hopefully!) merge your work\n\nYou're now part of the open-source ecosystem 💪\n\n---\n",
