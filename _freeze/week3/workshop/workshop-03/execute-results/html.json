Check the directory where you currently are\n\n::: {.unilur-solution}\n`pwd`\n:::\n\n2. Navigate to your Desktop (using `cd` and `ls` until you arrive at your destination).\n\n::: {.unilur-solution}\nUse `cd` and `ls` until you arrive at your destination\n:::\n\n\n3. List of files and directories you have on your desktop\n\n::: {.unilur-solution}\n`ls`\n:::\n\n4. Create a folder called `ETC5513_tutorial3`.  \nHint: `mkdir`\n\n::: {.unilur-solution}\n`mkdir ETC5513_tutorial3`\n:::\n\n5. Navigate into `ETC5513_tutorial3` and inside that folder create another folder called\n`Tutorial3`\n\n::: {.unilur-solution}\n`cd ETC5513_tutorial3`\n\n`mkdir Tutorial3`\n:::\n\n6.  Inside `ETC5513_tutorial3`  create two folders at the same time called `data` and `figures`\n\n::: {.unilur-solution}\n`mkdir data figures`\n:::\n\n7. Use the command `touch` to create two files inside Tutorial3 `example.qmd` `example1.qmd`\n\n::: {.unilur-solution}\n`cd Tutorial3`\n\n`touch Tutorial3/example.qmd Tutorail3/example1.qmd`\n:::\n    \n8.  Delete `example1.qmd`\n\n::: {.unilur-solution}\n`rm example1.qmd`\n:::\n\n9.  Inside `ETC5513_tutorial3` create a new file called `file1.txt`\n\n::: {.unilur-solution}\n`cd ..`\n\n`ls`\n\n`touch file1.txt`\n:::\n\n10.  Move `file1.txt` from `ETC5513_tutorial3` into a new folder (or directory) called `Example`. The folder `Example` and `ETC5513_tutorial3` should be at the same level.  \n**Hint:** mv\n\n::: {.unilur-solution}\n`cd ..`\n\n`mkdir Example`\n\n`mv ETC5513_tutorial3/file1.txt Example/file1.txt`\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 2: Git and GitHub configuration\n\n### 1. Git configuration\nOpen your command line interface/Terminal/Git Bash Shell window and type the following:\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nPlease replace \"Firstname lastname\" with your own details and choose a name that is identifiable for credit (this information is the one that identifies you)\n:::\n\n`git config --global user.name \"Firstname lastname\"`\n\nSet your **Monash email address** to be associated with each history commit:\n\n`git config --global user.email \"valid email address\"`\n\n\nNow go to your Rstudio session and follow the next steps:\n   \n- Select Tools from the menu and go to Global Options\n- Click Git/SVN on the left panel\n- Click Enable version control interface for RStudio projects at the top and continue with the steps below.\n       \nNext we are going to create an SSH key as follows (we want to do this to avoid having to input our GitHub credentials each time we interact with GitHub):\n       \n- Click on **Create SSH Key**  and another pop-up prompt will appear where you will be asked to provide a PassPhrase. You **do not need a passphrase**. It is considered more secure but be aware you will have to enter this phrase as a password _every time_ when the key is used.\n           \n\n![](../images/RSA2.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n- Click **View public key** and copy the key to the clipboard (ctrl c (Windows) or command c (mac)).\n\n![](../images/key.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n           \n- Navigate to GitHub and go to the top right corner where your avatar is, select your avatar and select **Settings** from the drop-down menu. \n\n![](../images/ssh_keys.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n-  Go to SSH and GPG keys item in the left side menu inside your GitHub account. Click the green \"New SSH key\" button and give your key a title and paste the key you copy from Rstudio in the step above into the Key text-box. Then click \"Add SSH key\".\n  \nThe process described above allows you to interact between your local Git and GitHub without having to write your GitHub logging details each time you do a git operation between your local and your remote repository.\n\n   \n### 2. Creating a repository on GitHub\n\nUsing your **internet browser**:\n\n1. Log in into your GitHub account following this [link](https://github.com) \n2. Create a new private repo called *Tutorial3* and make sure the repo is initialized with a README.md file by ticking on the option \"Initialize this repository with a README\" at the bottom of the page.\n3. Click the name *Tutorial3* to look inside your GitHub project, identify what is the **HTTPS**  and **SSH** address of this project by looking at the green tab (code).\n\nSee below the solutions:\n\n![](../images/newrepo.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n![](../images/creatingrepo.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n![](../images/httpclone.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n### 3. Cloning and modifying our first GitHub repo using our Terminal/Command line interface/Git Bash shell and with Rstudio \n\nUsing your **internet browser**:\n\n1. Clone the GitHub repository that you created in the previous exercise in your computer using the command line interface/Terminal/Git Bash shell. Remember that it is very important that you first decide where you want to clone the project in your computer and you navigate to that location using the command line interface/Terminal/Git Bash shell.\n\nThe git command to clone a GitHub repo is `git clone SSH-repo GitHub path` (SSH-repo GitHub path refers to the path that you will fine in your GitHub project page under Code > SSH and copy the address that you see, it will end in .git. Mine looks like this \n       \n`git@github.com:ETC5513demo/Tutorial3.git`\n\nThen proceed to clone the repository in your local machine using the command line interface/Terminal/Git Bash shell:\n            \n`git clone  git@github.com:github.com/ETC5513demo/Tutorial3.git` (replace the SSH with your own!)\n \n (you can obtain this from within your GitHub project --> code) \n\n2. You will be prompted to input your GitHub log in details (only for this time). Enter your GitHub user name and password\n\n3. Open your Rstudio and create a **New Project** associated with the folder of the GitHub repository that you just cloned in step 1:\n\n**Projects > Create a New project > From an existing directory**\n\nFrom the bottom left pane in your Rstudio open the README.md file and add the following sentence:\n \n\"This repository is an example about how to integrate GitHub with Rstudio\"\n\n4.  In your command line interface/Terminal/Git Bash shell type `git status` and observe that the file has been marked as modified.\n\n5. Add this file to the staging area, create a commit and push the changes to the remote repository using our command line interface/Terminal/Git Bash shell.  \n**Hints:** `git add filename`; `git commit -m \"Commit message\"`; `git push origin main`. Remember that you can use git status at anytime during this process to see the status of your git repository. In summary:\n\n::: {.unilur-solution}\n`git add README.md` (or `git add *` or `git add .`, to commit all the changes in all the files at once)\n\n`git commit -m \"Adding project explanation\"`\n\n`git push origin master`\n:::\n",
